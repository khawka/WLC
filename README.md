# WLC


The algorith of "A new local algorithm for overlapping community detection based on clustering coefficient and common neighbour similarity" is uploaded in file WLC code.
use the packages
import networkx as nx
import time
The function WLC  inputs are: path: the path of txt file containing edges of graph
    sep : the used separator in the file of edges
 Run this function using: WLC(path, sep)
The Output: is the file results containing overlapping communities
	
The function of overlapping modularity inputs: G the graph , N the number of edges in the graph, res list of communities
